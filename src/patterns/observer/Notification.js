 * @class puremvc.Notification
 *
 * A base Notification implementation.
 *
 * PureMVC does not rely upon underlying event models such as the one provided
 * with the DOM or other browser centric W3C event models.
 *
 * The Observer Pattern as implemented within PureMVC exists to support
 * event-driven communication between the application and the actors of the MVC
 * triad.
 *
 * Notifications are not meant to be a replacement for events in the browser.
 * Generally, Mediator implementors place event listeners on their view
 * components, which they then handle in the usual way. This may lead to the
 * broadcast of Notifications to trigger commands or to communicate with other
 * Mediators. {@link puremvc.Proxy Proxy},
 * {@link puremvc.SimpleCommand SimpleCommand}
 * and {@link puremvc.MacroCommand MacroCommand}
 * instances communicate with each other and
 * {@link puremvc.Mediator Mediator}s
 * by broadcasting Notifications.
 *
 * A key difference between browser events and PureMVC Notifications is that
 * events follow the 'Chain of Responsibility' pattern, 'bubbling' up the
 * display hierarchy until some parent component handles the event, while
 * PureMVC Notification follow a 'Publish/Subscribe' pattern. PureMVC classes
 * need not be related to each other in a parent/child relationship in order to
 * communicate with one another using Notifications.
 *

 * @param {string} name
